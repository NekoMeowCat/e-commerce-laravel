**Laravel Breeze**
Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, Breeze includes a simple "profile" page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Additionally, Breeze provides scaffolding options based on Livewire or Inertia, with the choice of using Vue or React for the Inertia-based scaffolding.

**Installation**
First, you should create a new Laravel application, configure your database, and run your database migrations. Once you have created a new Laravel application, you may install Laravel Breeze using Composer:

**composer require laravel/breeze --dev**

After Composer has installed the Laravel Breeze package, you may run the breeze:install Artisan command. This command publishes the authentication views, routes, controllers, and other resources to your application. Laravel Breeze publishes all of its code to your application so that you have full control and visibility over its features and implementation.

The breeze:install command will prompt you for your preferred frontend stack and testing framework:

php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev
